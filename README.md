## Inspiration

People are social and people have daily patterns, but sometimes we are not aware of people having the same routine as us. What there was a platform that could help you get value out of these missed connections?

## What it does

Hexplore helps you discover the opportunities around you by matching you with the people you run into frequently. It helps you meet up with people you encounter frequently, while also indicating what value these people could have for you.

## How we built it

To build Hexplore, we used a simple and reliable software stack, consisting of a native Android front-end developed in Kotlin, powered by a Flask + PostgreSQL backend hosted on Heroku. Users first log in to the Android app with their Facebook account. The app uses the Bluetooth Low Energy technology (BLE) to broadcast simple signals containing device IDs. Those IDs captured by nearby devices are then matched with IDs stored at the backend associated with Facebook profiles of owners of the devices.

## Challenges we ran into

One of the biggest challenges was coming up with an idea. We have gone through quite some different ideas before settling on this one. Also, our team was mostly unknown to each other before the event, so next to building a product, we were building friendships as well, which succeeded!

## Accomplishments that we’re proud of

We are proud of how we managed to develop an amazing product, incorporating new technologies with a totally new team in 36 hours!

We are also proud of how much fun we had during the building of this product.

## What we learned

We learned how to use technology to bring people together and create a better world in this way. We also learned how to use conventional technologies such as bluetooth in an unconventional way.

## What's next for Future society

We hope that Hexplore will become a product used by many people around the world to connect people who can benefit from eachother.
